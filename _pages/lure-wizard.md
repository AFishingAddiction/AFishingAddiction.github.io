description: A Fishing Addiction's Lure Wizard asks a few simple questions and provides you with suggestions for lures to use. It asks for the season, water clarity and visibility, and the clous coverage or frontal status. With just those 3 questions, we are able to provide you with up to 8 different types of lures and the recommended color.
