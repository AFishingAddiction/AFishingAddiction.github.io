        <p><a href="http://bit.ly/2KZvVAW" target="_blank"><img src="/images/The-Pro-Bass-Fishing-Training-Manual_FrontCoverSmall.png" alt="" class="float-left" /></a> I recommend the Pro-Bass Fishing Training Manual if you are serious about considering a professional fishing career. The author, Randy Meyers, has over 50 years of fishing experience and compiled all those years of knowledge into an easy to read, 14-chapter eBook.</p>
        <p>He covers topics from locating bass on different types of water, to how you adapt to changing conditions using different techniques, to how you can establish patterns to land the bass in any various situations.</p>
