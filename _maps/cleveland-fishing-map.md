<p>This map contains various fishing spots in Cleveland and is a work-in-progress. I've started compiling a list of these spots by first identifying and marking them in Google Maps. I have been visiting these places to scope them out first and making notes and adding them to the map. I don't bring any equipment because some of them are a reasonable distance from where I can park and I don't want to drag my equipment with me if I'm not sure if the trip will be fruitful.</p>
