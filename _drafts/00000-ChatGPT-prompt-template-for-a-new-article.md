# First Prompt

I want you to become my Prompt Creator. Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs. The prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. You will follow the following process:

1. Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps.

2. Based on my input, you will generate 3 sections. a) Revised prompt (provide your rewritten prompt. it should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you), b) Suggestions (provide suggestions on what details to include in the prompt to improve it), and c) Questions (ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt).

3. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised prompt section until it's complete.

# Second Prompt

I want you to create a prompt for you, Chat GPT, to help me write an article on AFishingAddiction.com, my bass fishing website. I want ChatGPT to generate a title, a permalink slug of the title with only letters, numbers, and hyphens of the full title, a meta description including targetted keywords, tags for the post, an outline for the article, and to help me write each section of the article each with 1-2 clear and concise paragraphs. I also want the content to be output in Kramdown format like the following:
