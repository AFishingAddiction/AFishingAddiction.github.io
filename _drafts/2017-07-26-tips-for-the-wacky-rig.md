If you're just starting out using the wacky rig, the idea of using it can be...well...wacky. Here are a few tips that will help you out with fishing this type of rig and hopefully will help you catch more bass when using it.

## Use Weedless Hooks
This may not always be an obvious tip, but use weedless hooks for your wacky rig. It's going to save you a lot of time cleaning off your hook between each cast. Using a weedless hook is especially useful when you are punching it through mats of vegetation and retrieving through them as well.

## Use Weights
Using a wacky rig without any weight is pretty much pointless. If you don't use a weight, your worm is going to take several seconds longer to reach the bottom. Adding weight to the rig will help with the presentation.
There are many types of weights that can be used, but I'm going to recommend two of them. The first one is a pencil weight or nail sinker. These are typically inserted into the center of the worm and the hook is then inserted around the backside of the weight.
The second type of weight I recommend is actually a weight system specifically made for wacky rigs. It operates the same way as a rubber band would in that you slide the weight all the way to the middle and you insert the hook into the slits in the weight. This type of weight also protects the worm so that the hook doesn't break it down as much. I would recommend this approach over the pencil weights.

## Flip to the Edges
## Fresh bait
## Stick Worms, not curly tail

I hope these tips will help you be be more effiecient and use the right applications to your wacky rig.
