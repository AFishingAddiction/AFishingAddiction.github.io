For Christmas 2011, I asked Santa to upgrade my plastic tackle box to a canvas tackle bag. He didn&#8217;t bring me one, but he did give me a gift card for Gander Mountain and asked me to pick out my own. Given the small amount of lures and baits I had at the time, this is what I picked out:

<div id='gallery-5' class='gallery galleryid-165 gallery-columns-2 gallery-size-responsive-300'>
  <dl class='gallery-item'>
    <dt class='gallery-icon portrait'>
      <a href="/images/my-first-tackle-bag-1456x2592.jpg" rel="lightbox[gallery-5]"><img width="300" height="534" src="/images/my-first-tackle-bag-1456x2592.jpg" class="attachment-responsive-300" alt="My first tackle bag" /></a>
    </dt>
    
    <dd class='wp-caption-text gallery-caption'>
      My new tackle bag
    </dd>
  </dl>
  
  <dl class='gallery-item'>
    <dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>
      <a href="/images/my-first-tackle-bag-filled-2592x1456.jpg" rel="lightbox[gallery-5]"><img width="300" height="168" src="/images/my-first-tackle-bag-filled-2592x1456.jpg" class="attachment-responsive-300" alt="Tackle bag filled with bait and lures" /></a>
    </dt>
    
    <dd class='wp-caption-text gallery-caption'>
      Tackle bag filled with bait and lures
    </dd>
  </dl>
  
  <br style="clear: both" />
</div>

This tackle bagÂ has worked out great over the years and has definitely served its purpose. I have finally outgrown its capacity and have needed to carry along a second, smaller bag to carry my plastic baits.
