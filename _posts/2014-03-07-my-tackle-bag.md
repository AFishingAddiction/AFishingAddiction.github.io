For Christmas 2011, I asked Santa to upgrade my plastic tackle box to a canvas tackle bag. He didn&#8217;t bring me one, but he did give me a gift card for Gander Mountain and asked me to pick out my own. Given the small amount of lures and baits I had at the time, this is what I picked out:

  <dl class='gallery-item'>
    <dt class='gallery-icon portrait'>
      <a href="/images/my-first-tackle-bag-1456x2592.jpg" rel="lightbox[gallery-5]"><img width="300" height="534" src="/images/my-first-tackle-bag-1456x2592.jpg" class="attachment-responsive-300" alt="My first canvas tackle bag" /></a>
    </dt>

    <dd class='wp-caption-text gallery-caption'>

</div>

This canvas tackle bagÂ has worked out great over the years and has definitely served its purpose. It's nice a light and it forces you to pick and choose only the best lures and baits to take with you. It's great for the beginner angler. However, I have finally outgrown its capacity and have needed to carry along a second, smaller bag to carry my plastic baits. It's definitely time for an upgrade, but I do recommend staying lean as long as possible. Carrying more than what time bag can hold can get heavy and slow you down if you like to be on the move when fishing the banks.
