1. An Arbor Knot is tied first by taking the tag end of the line and making a loop around the arbor of the reel. Then, take the tag end of the line and tie an overhand knot around the main line.
2. Then tie another overhand knot at the end of the tag end.
3. & 4. Pull the line between the first knot and the reel to cinch the knots together. The tag end knot should push up against the first overhand knot, preventing the knots from slipping or untying. Optionally, you can wet the knots before cinching them together. 
5. Lastly, pull main line to cinch the knots to the arbor and trim the tag end.

## What is the best knot for tying fishing line to a reel?
An Arbor Knot is the best knot to tie your fishing line to your reel-- any type of reel.

## Why is it called an Arbor Knot?
The center of a fishing reel that has the line spooled around it is called the arbor. The arbor knot is used to tie a fishing line around that arbor.

## Do I need to wet the line when cinching an Arbor Knot?
Itâ€™s not necessary, but it is recommended to wet all fishing line knots with saliva before cinching down. This will prevent friction which can lead to weakening the line.

## Can I use an Arbor Knot on all types of reels?
Yes. The Arbor Knot is really versatile when it comes to tying it to many different reels. It works on baitcaster reels, spinning reels, fly fishing reels, and others.

## Can I use an Arbor Knot on all types of line?
