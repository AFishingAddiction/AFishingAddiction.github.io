## What is the best knot for tying fishing line to a reel?
An Arbor Knot is the best knot to tie your fishing line to your reel-- any type of reel.

## Why is it called an Arbor Knot?
The center of a fishing reel that has the line spooled around it is called the arbor. The arbor knot is used to tie a fishing line around that arbor.

## Do I need to wet the line when cinching an Arbor Knot?
Itâ€™s not necessary, but it is recommended to wet all fishing line knots with saliva before cinching down. This will prevent friction which can lead to weakening the line.

## Can I use an Arbor Knot on all types of reels?
Yes. The Arbor Knot is really versatile when it comes to tying it to many different reels. It works on baitcaster reels, spinning reels, fly fishing reels, and others.

## Can I use an Arbor Knot on all types of line?
Yes. The Arbor Knot is effective when tying on monofilament, fluorocarbon, braided, or even fly fishing line.
