After a painful winter of 2011, I went out in Mid-March 2012 to Wingfoot Lake pond and caught these beautiful largemouth bass. This was at the same pond I caught my [first large bass](/2014/02/11/this-is-when-it-all-began/ "first large bass"). If I remember correctly, I was using Berkeley Gulp Alive minnows at the time.

According to my photo timestamps, I caught these 4 days apart. But judging by the size, this very well could be the same fish. It&#8217;s hard to tell since the 2 photos are on the opposite sides of the fish.
