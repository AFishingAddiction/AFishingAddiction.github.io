## Flipping Jigs

Alright, anglers, let's dive right into the world of flipping jigs – a secret weapon in the arsenal of many seasoned bass anglers. If you're looking to target those big, elusive bass hiding in heavy cover, flipping jigs are your go-to buddies.

### So, what exactly are flipping jigs and what's their superpower?
Well, picture this: you're fishing in thick, weedy areas or under submerged trees and docks where those lunker bass like to hang out. Flipping jigs are your ticket to getting into those tight spots.
