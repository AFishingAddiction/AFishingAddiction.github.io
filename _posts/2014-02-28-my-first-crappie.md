After catching this crappie, I immediately texted my uncle asking what species it was. I had no idea, as I was still new at fishing at that point.

I also yanked a few other fish out of a small stream nearby. I'm not sure what species they were. I caught both species on a Berkeley Gulp chartreuse minnow. That's what I used most of the time when I first started out. I can't seem to find them anymore.
