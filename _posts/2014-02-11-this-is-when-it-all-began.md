I had a few family camping trips as a child during which I caught a quite a few bluegills (I have the pictures to prove it). However, after catching this beast in 2011, my fishing addiction commenced.

I caught this in a little pond in Wingfoot Lake Park back in 2011. I was fishing with my brother-in-law that day. Luckily he was there to take the picture, because apparently I had trouble holding it up.
