Early in the 2012 season, I came across a great spot along the Cuyahoga River in Akron. It&#8217;s a great spot for wading in your bare feet and keeping cool. It&#8217;s a little bit of a hike from the parking lot, but well worth it. I&#8217;ve caught several Smallmouth Bass from many different angles along the shore and from the island in the center of the river.

As shown in the picture below, there is a nice bend in the river, with it splitting off two ways and merging again, creating an island. On the downstream side of the island is a fallen tree that is and has been stationary. My usual standing spot is on the &#8220;beach&#8221; toward the very center of the picture. The water is a lot deeper on the opposite side of that spot. And since Smallmouth Bass prefer moving water, it didn&#8217;t surprise me that I caught a few in the fast current.
