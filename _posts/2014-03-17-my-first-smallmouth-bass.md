Early in the 2012 season, I came across a great spot along the Cuyahoga River in Akron. It's a great spot for wading in your bare feet and keeping cool. It's a little bit of a hike from the parking lot, but well worth it. I've caught several Smallmouth Bass from many different angles along the shore and from the island in the center of the river.

As shown in the picture below, there is a nice bend in the river, with it splitting off two ways and merging again, creating an island. On the downstream side of the island is a fallen tree that is and has been stationary. My usual standing spot is on the "beach" toward the very center of the picture. The water is a lot deeper on the opposite side of that spot. And since Smallmouth Bass prefer moving water, it didn't surprise me that I caught a few in the fast current.
