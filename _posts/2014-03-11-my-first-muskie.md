title: My First Muskie
excerpt: I really wasn't sure what it was at the time, but after looking at the photos, I figured out it was a muskie and not a pike based on the direction of the stripes.

I know it's not very big _at all_, but here is my very first muskie. And at the time of writing this post, it is the only muskie I have ever caught. I really wasn't sure what it was at the time, but after looking at the photos, I figured out it was a muskie and not a pike based on the direction of the stripes.

The coordinates in the map are approximate, since my phone didn't capture the GPS coordinates. I do remember that it was along the north side of Mogadore Reservoir, between Route 43 and Congress Lake Road. There is a trail that runs along that side with very few spots that have shore access. I bet if I went back to that area I'd be able to find the spot.
