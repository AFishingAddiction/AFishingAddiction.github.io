  I want to thank you for your time and effort building this website and
  detailing the map. I drive within 10 miles of this every day for work and have
  never fished it! Those days are over. I think I was a little intimidated by
  the sheer size of the area and wasn't sure where to start. What's that old
  Chinesee proverb? "the longest journey begins with one step"
